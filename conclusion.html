    <p style="font-family: 'Roboto',sans-serif; font-size: large; text-align: justify;">
        1. Initially, I visited houses in Saraswathi Nagar, Nellore, conducting a survey on cleanliness practices. After analyzing the data, I realized there was a lack of awareness regarding proper sanitation and hygiene. To address this, I planned an awareness program focusing on Swachh Bharat objectives. I created diagrammatic presentations and charts to educate the community on:
        * Current cleanliness situation in the area
        * Instructions on maintaining a hygienic environment
        * Proper waste management practices
        * Importance of personal hygiene
        * Benefits of a clean surrounding

        <br><br>

        2. In the second week, we delved deeper into the community's cleanliness habits to prepare future awareness initiatives. We met with local groups to understand their challenges in maintaining cleanliness and existing knowledge of sanitation practices. Analyzing this data helped us identify trends in waste management, the link between access to sanitation facilities and cleanliness awareness, and preliminary community needs. Cultural sensitivities were addressed through research on cleanliness habits specific to the community. This knowledge informed the development of culturally appropriate educational materials on Swachh Bharat.
        <br><br>
        
        3. The third week was dedicated to bringing our Swachh Bharat workshop for kids to life! We finalized an engaging agenda and activities to make cleanliness fun for our young audience. We practiced our presentation and created eye-catching visuals about proper waste disposal and hand hygiene. We delivered the workshop over two days, facilitating discussions and activities on the importance of a clean environment. The feedback collected will help us improve future Swachh Bharat awareness programs.
        <br><br>
        
        4. In the fourth week, we focused on analyzing the collected data on cleanliness practices. Using data analysis tools, we explored trends and patterns in responses to our cleanliness surveys. This helped us identify key characteristics of the community's sanitation habits and areas needing improvement.
        <br><br>
        
        5. For week five, we designed a vibrant infographic showcasing the most common cleanliness patterns observed in the community. We tracked trends by age group and neighborhood, illustrating how sanitation practices in our target area have evolved since the start of the Swachh Bharat campaign. We examined how access to proper sanitation facilities has influenced cleanliness habits.
        <br><br>
        
        6. In the sixth week, we made significant progress in understanding our community's approach to cleanliness. We analyzed the data gathered through surveys and interviews, uncovering interesting trends about local sanitation practices. This knowledge will help us tailor the next phase of our Swachh Bharat project to effectively promote proper waste management and hygiene within our community.
        <br><br>
        
        7. In the final two weeks, I worked on creating a webpage to showcase all my Swachh Bharat activities and display a gallery of our cleanliness drives and awareness programs. This marks the successful completion of my Swachh Bharat community service project.
